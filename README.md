File Organization:

The project is organized into four JavaScript files.
models.js contains the Student class and data structure.
database.js simulates asynchronous data fetching.
analytics.js includes calculation and filtering functions.
main.js connects all parts and runs the logic

Challenges Faced :

This project was the first experience working with a multi-file architecture in JavaScript, where the focus was mainly on logic and object-oriented design, similar to Java.
Understanding the differences and similarities between Java and JavaScript in implementing OOP and handling asynchronous functions was challenging at first, 
but it helped improve the understanding of the program structure.
